Notes on states: 
For the following states, we have absolutely no data from 5.38 and I could not find them elsewhere: 
Alaska 2012 
Delaware 2012 
Idaho 1988  
Mississippi 2012 
Wyoming 2004 
Wyoming 2012 
How to handle such situation ? Train with less data? We could try out.
Question: Do we want to perform a classification task ? Ie vote = Rep or Dem, or do we want to perform 
a Regression task when obtaining the repartition of votes for every state ? 
How are we going to encode the collinearity matrix ? for the weights
How to account for non-Rep and non-Dem winners? Like Vermont and Bernie
